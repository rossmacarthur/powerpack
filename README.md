Supercharge your [Alfred ðŸŽ©][alfred] workflows by building them in Rust ðŸ¦€!

## ðŸš€ Getting started

This project contains a `powerpack` crate which provides types for developing
script filter Alfred workflows in Rust. It also provides a command line tool to
initialize, build, and install  workflows built using the `powerpack` crate.

Firstly, install the command line tool.
```sh
cargo install powerpack-cli
```

Now create a new project using a similar API as `cargo new` or `cargo init`.
```sh
powerpack new myworkflow && cd myworkflow
```

This will create a new Rust project as well as a `workflow/` directory
containing information about your Alfred workflow. The following will create
a release build of the workflow and copy it to the `workflow/` directory.
```sh
powerpack build --release
```

Now you can link it to Alfred. The following will symlink the `workflow/`
directory to the Alfred preferences folder.
```sh
powerpack link
```

Now you can run the workflow from Alfred âœ¨!

To package a `.alfredworkflow` file for release you can run the following.
```sh
powerpack package
```

The release will be available at `target/workflow/myworkflow.alfredworkflow`.

## ðŸ¤¸ Usage

The following is a "Hello World!" Alfred workflow built using `powerpack`.

```rust
use std::env;
use std::error::Error;
use std::iter;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Alfred passes in a single argument for the user query.
    let arg = env::args().nth(1);
    let query = arg.as_deref().unwrap_or("");

    // Create an item to show in the Alfred drop down.
    let item = powerpack::Item::new("Hello World!")
        .subtitle(format!("Your query was '{}'", query));

    // Output the item to Alfred!
    powerpack::output(iter::once(item))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This would render an item as shown.

## ðŸ‘· GitHub Action

[`setup-crate`][setup] can be used to install `powerpack` in a GitHub Actions
workflow. For example:
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: extractions/setup-crate@v1
    with:
      owner: rossmacarthur
      name: powerpack
  - run: powerpack package
  # produces an artifact at `target/workflow/{name}.alfredworkflow`
```
